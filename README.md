# Bootcamp Portfolio

## Project
This is a project in which, we are tasked to create a portfolio showcasing our wor,k utilising our knowledge of CSS thus far. Predominantly the use of 'CSS Grids' & 'CSS Flexbox', as that is what serves the basis of this website. As well as using either 'CSS Grids' 'CSS Flexbox' our knowledge of using selectors are also explored within this project as that helps us style the page to suit the acceptance criteria. Lastly 'CSS MediaQueries' is also introduced, so that the website is responsive on different screen sizes.

### Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria for this project are as follows:
1. When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you.
2. When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
3. When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications.
4. When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
5. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
6. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

### Outcome
I was able to successfully hit all the criteria stated above.
- When the page is loaded, the viewer is presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me.
- The links in the naviagtion are all working and the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- The 'Work' section has titled images of my application (There is one application working, and the rest are placeholder images and names, which will be updated as I complete more projects)
- The first application's image is larger than the others in size.
- The images of the applications when clicked are taken to that deployed application (As stated above, only one application is currently deployed, the rest are placeholder names and images).
- Through the use of MEdiaQueries when the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices the layout is responsive and adapts to the viewport.
